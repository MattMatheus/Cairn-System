# PM Refinement Directive

Run this cycle when QA has created intake bugs or when `delivery-backlog/engineering/active/` is empty.

## Accessibility Profile (Mandatory)
Before step 1, select and record active profile(s) for this cycle:
- `low-vision-default`
- `high-variability-attention`
- both (if needed)
Keep queues and recommendations single-focus and avoid multi-level task blocks.

## PM Refinement Cycle (Mandatory)
1. Review new items in `delivery-backlog/engineering/intake/`.
2. Run intake validation before moving any items:
   - `tools/validate_intake_items.sh`
3. If validation fails:
   - fix missing metadata fields or invalid status values in-place;
   - move misfiled `ARCH-*` items to `delivery-backlog/architecture/intake/`;
   - move misfiled `STORY-*`/`BUG-*` items to `delivery-backlog/engineering/intake/`;
   - rerun `tools/validate_intake_items.sh` until it passes.
4. Refine each item into clear, actionable stories/bug cards.
   - If a council artifact exists (`workspace/research/planning/sessions/COUNCIL-*.md`), translate recommendation into backlog-ready stories before ranking.
5. Rank and move refined items to `delivery-backlog/engineering/active/` in execution order.
   - Apply product-first weighting from `knowledge-base/process/BACKLOG_WEIGHTING_POLICY.md`.
   - Process stories may outrank product work only when a broken process is blocking delivery or gate enforcement.
6. Update `delivery-backlog/engineering/active/README.md` Active Sequence.
   - Verify queue/order updates remain consistent with `delivery-backlog/STATE_TRANSITION_CHECKLIST.md`.
7. Update queue truth in `delivery-backlog/engineering/active/README.md` and any observer/read-model artifacts touched by the cycle.
8. Ensure active stories include traceability metadata (`idea_id`, `phase`, `adr_refs`, metric field).
9. Update `stage-prompts/active/next-agent-seed-prompt.md` only if special launch instructions are needed.
10. Run observer:
   - `tools/run_observer_cycle.sh --cycle-id PM-<date>-<slug>`
11. Commit once for this cycle:
   - `cycle-<cycle-id>`

## Constraints
- Preserve QA priority intent (`P0` highest urgency).
- Keep stories small, testable, and explicit.
- Do not implement fixes in PM mode.
- Do not treat Research Council as final decision authority; human/operator direction remains authoritative.
- Apply stage exit requirements in `knowledge-base/process/STAGE_EXIT_GATES.md`.
- Do not commit before observer report is generated.
