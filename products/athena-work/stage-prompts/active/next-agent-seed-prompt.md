# Next Agent Directive (Engineering)

Your task is to execute the top story in `delivery-backlog/engineering/active/`.

## Accessibility Profile (Mandatory)
Before step 1, select and record active profile(s) for this cycle:
- `low-vision-default`
- `high-variability-attention`
- both (if needed)
Use single-task focus and concise recovery steps in all outputs.

## Launch Rule
- If `delivery-backlog/engineering/active/` has no story files, report exactly: `no stories`.
- Do not fabricate work when active is empty.
- Product management should run only when active is empty.

## Implementation Cycle (Mandatory)
1. Take the top story from `delivery-backlog/engineering/active/`.
2. Read, research, and implement. Surface questions if outcome is unclear.
   - Apply `delivery-backlog/STATE_TRANSITION_CHECKLIST.md` before moving story state.
3. Update tests.
4. Run tests with the canonical docs command (`tools/run_doc_tests.sh`) plus any story-specific test commands. Tests must pass.
   - Include `go test ./...` before handoff.
   - Run quality gate checks before handoff:
     - `gofmt -w <changed-go-files>` for Go edits
     - `go test ./...` for Go changes
     - `shellcheck <changed-shell-scripts>` when shell scripts change (if available)
     - `markdownlint <changed-markdown-files>` when docs change (if available)
   - If a quality tool is unavailable in the environment, report it explicitly in handoff notes.
5. Prepare handoff package.
6. Move the story to `delivery-backlog/engineering/qa/`.
7. Do not commit yet; cycle commit occurs only after QA + observer.

## Handoff Package (Required)
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Test updates made
- Test run results
- Open risks/questions
- Recommended QA focus areas
- New gaps discovered during implementation (as intake story paths in `delivery-backlog/engineering/intake/`)

## Constraints
- Do not skip tests.
- Use `tools/run_doc_tests.sh` as the default docs validation entrypoint.
- Run and report quality-gate checks for the changed file types before handoff.
- Do not move story to done directly from active.
- Respect accepted ADRs and state-harness scope.
- If a gap is discovered, log a new intake story before handoff.
- Apply stage exit requirements in `knowledge-base/process/STAGE_EXIT_GATES.md`.
