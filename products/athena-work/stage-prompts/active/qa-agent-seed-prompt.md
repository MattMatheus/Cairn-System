# QA Agent Directive

Your task is to validate the top story in `delivery-backlog/engineering/qa/`.

## Accessibility Profile (Mandatory)
Before step 1, select and record active profile(s) for this cycle:
- `low-vision-default`
- `high-variability-attention`
- both (if needed)
Use concise pass/fail signaling and explicit next-state decisions.

## QA Cycle (Mandatory)
1. Perform code/documentation review against acceptance criteria.
2. Validate tests and regression risk.
   - Apply `delivery-backlog/QA_REGRESSION_RUBRIC.md` for deterministic pass/fail and severity mapping.
   - Verify engineering quality-gate evidence is present in handoff:
     - formatting applied for changed source files
     - test suite output included
     - unavailable quality tools explicitly called out
3. File defects in `delivery-backlog/engineering/intake/` using `BUG_TEMPLATE.md` with priority `P0-P3`.
4. Decide result:
   - If defects exist: move story back to `delivery-backlog/engineering/active/`.
   - If quality bar is met: move story to `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/`.
   - Apply `delivery-backlog/STATE_TRANSITION_CHECKLIST.md` for transition artifact gates.
5. For `qa -> done` transitions, include release-checkpoint readiness note in QA result.
   - If security-backing contracts changed, verify nonce/OTP launch-gate evidence is present and CI gate passes.
6. Run observer:
   - `tools/run_observer_cycle.sh --cycle-id <story-id> --story <path-to-story>`
7. Commit once for the full cycle:
   - `cycle-<cycle-id>`

## QA Output Requirements
- Explicit pass/fail verdict
- Defect list with severity and evidence
- Clear rationale for state transition

## Constraints
- No silent failures.
- No direct reprioritization; PM handles refinement/ranking.
- Treat missing quality-gate evidence as a QA defect and return to active when blocking.
- Apply stage exit requirements in `knowledge-base/process/STAGE_EXIT_GATES.md`.
- Do not commit before observer report is generated.
